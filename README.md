# TipTrip

## Concept:
TipTrip was made to help people get around without needing to pay a lot or get in the car with a stranger. This app connects you with people you already know to see if they have a vehicle and are able to either pick you up or let you borrow their car.

Sign up:
Create an account and enter in your location and your vehicle information if you have one. If you do plan to be a driver or offer your car, you can set a custom fee so your friends know what to expect.

Add your friends:
Navigate to the contacts section to find your friends so you can see who is available with a car and what car they have.

Set Your Availability:
Setting your availability lets your friends know if you are currently available to pick them up or for them to come borrow your car.

Message Friends:
TipTrip utilizes your devices sms messaging app to communicate with your friends.

See that a friend is listed as available?
Send them a text to see if they can pick you up or schedule a time to pick you up.
See that they aren't available?
Send them a text asking if you can borrow their car at a later date.
Moving and specifically need a truck?
Search through your contacts to see which of your friends has a truck and send them a text to see if you can borrow it!
Rate your friends:
Have some feedback you want to leave for you your friends so others can see if they are dependable? Leave them a review through the app so others can see it when they view their friends page.

## Technologies Used:
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - Python
    - Django
    - JavaScript

## Approach:
I initailly set off by designing my wireframes which I learned was a mistake as I didn't account for how my data models would relate to one another. Once I did that, I had to edit my wireframes and add more functionality. 

Eventually I removed functionality as I did not see the value it was adding and wanted to simplofy the app. 

## Challenges:
The main challenges of this app were figuring out the models and how they connect as well as deplying on Heroku. I worked through these by reaching out to my colleagues and my good friend Google. 

## Additional information 
The app is meant to be used on a mobile device but can be used on desktop.
